# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## Introduction

Brain Tumor Detection using CNN is a project aimed at leveraging the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to accurately identify and localize brain tumors in medical MRI images. This project serves as a valuable tool for medical professionals in diagnosing and treating brain tumors effectively.

## Features

- **CNN**: Utilizes the CNN architecture for precise segmentation and localization of brain tumors in MRI images.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy in detecting brain tumors, enabling early diagnosis and intervention.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for uploading MRI images, performing tumor detection, and visualizing results.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of real-time processing, allowing for quick assessment and diagnosis of brain tumor cases.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of MRI images efficiently, making it suitable for use in medical facilities of varying sizes.


## Usage

1. Upload MRI images: Use the provided interface to upload MRI images containing brain scans.
2. Perform detection: Click the "Detect Tumor" button to initiate the tumor detection process using CNN.
